# Banking-Database-System

Creating a banking database system where a customer opens a bank account providing all the details required by the bank for account creation.
The banks find it hard to retrieve customer information based on only basic parameters like customer name, account number, etc.
By creating relations between entities we can eliminate redundant data as well as handling of similarinformation. 
Identification of customers is another issue faced. By using more number of parameters we can ease the identification of customers.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT-

Specify relations between entities involved in a banking management system. One-to-many, many-to-one, etc.
Understand how the banking systems work.
Storing and operating on the information using SQL queries.
Determining the active and inactive customers based on transaction dates.
Understand the attributes involved in a banking system like account types, transaction history, etc

ACTIONS -

Created users, entities, clusters, attributes for a banking database using Oracle Database based on well-defined business rules.
